Hi! I'm a developer, designer, visual artist and writer. I make a lot of stuff and I'm always in the process of gaining skills to make even more stuff. I work with a wide array of programming languages. My preferred domain is web development with MERN or Django stacks. However, I'm never afraid to discover and explore.
